    "\n",
    "[Post-Newtonian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Newtonian_expansion) results in some of the longest and most complex mathematical expressions ever derived by humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These expressions form the core of most gravitational wave data analysis codes, but generally the expressions are written in a format that is either inaccessible by others (i.e., closed-source) or written directly in e.g., C code and thus incompatible with symbolic algebra packages like [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or the Python-based [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once in a symbolic algebra package, these expressions could be manipulated, extended, and output as *more* optimized C codes (e.g., using SymPy/NRPy+, thus speeding up gravitational wave data analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository aims to provide a trusted source for validated Post-Newtonian expressions useful for gravitational wave astronomy, using the open-source [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) computer algebra system, so that expressions can be output into [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or highly optimized C codes using the SymPy-based [NRPy+](http://nrpyplus.net/).\n",
